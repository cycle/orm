Cycle is PHP DataMapper and ORM engine designed to work in long-running PHP applications (like [RoadRunner](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner)). The ORM provides hard separation between entity objects and their persistent representation which allows to use any type of data carrying object and model database schema on a fly.
