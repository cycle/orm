 * NullHeap is a heap implementation that does nothing.
 * It is useful when you are using ORM only for reading and you don't need to cache the loaded data.
 *
 * Effects of using NullHeap:
 * - Less memory consumption
 * - No need to clean the heap after each request in long-living applications
 * - You won't be able to update entities in the database. ORM will consider each loaded entity as newly created.
